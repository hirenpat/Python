#Problem_set_1
This problem set will introduce you to using control flow in Python and formulating a computational solution to a problem. 
It will also give you a chance to explore bisection search. This problem set has three problems.

#Problem_set_2
This problem set will introduce you to the topic of creating functions in Python, as well as looping mechanisms for repeating a computational process 
until a condition is reached.
